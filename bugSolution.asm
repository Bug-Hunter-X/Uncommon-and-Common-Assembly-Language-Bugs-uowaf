To mitigate some of these risks:

1. **Bounds Checking:** Before accessing memory locations, always check that the index or pointer is within the valid range of the array or buffer.  This requires extra instructions but significantly improves the safety of your code.

2. **Integer Overflow/Underflow Handling:**  Use larger data types if you anticipate very large or small numbers, or implement checks for overflow/underflow.  Modern processors might have built-in mechanisms to detect these conditions.

3. **Division by Zero:** Always check the divisor for zero before performing division.  The solution could be a conditional jump to handle the potential zero division exception.

4. **Variable Initialization:** Always initialize your variables before use to ensure predictable behavior and prevent undefined values from causing errors.

Here's how the solution might appear (Illustrative):

; Example using bounds checking
mov ecx, someIndex
; Check index bounds (assuming arraySize is known)
cmp ecx, arraySize
jge errorHandling ; Jump to error handler if index out of bounds
mov eax, [array + ecx * 4] ; Access array element

; Example for division by zero check:
mov eax, dividend
mov ebx, divisor
cmp ebx, 0
je errorHandling ; Jump to error handler if divisor is zero
idiv ebx 

; Error handling routine (replace with your error handling)
errorHandling:
; Handle the error appropriately (e.g., exit program, set error flag)
mov eax, -1 ;indicate error 
ret
