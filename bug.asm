mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4] ; potential buffer overflow if ecx is too large

mov eax, dword ptr [ebx+ecx*4] ; another example of potential buffer overflow

add eax, ebx ; potential integer overflow if eax and ebx are very large numbers

sub eax, ebx ; potential integer underflow if eax is a small number and ebx is a very large number

imul eax, ebx ; potential integer overflow if eax and ebx are large numbers

idiv ebx ; potential division by zero if ebx is zero

; Potential issues with uninitialized variables
mov eax, [someUninitializedVariable]

; Incorrect array indexing or pointer arithmetic
mov eax, [array+ecx*8] ; potential out-of-bounds access if ecx is too large
